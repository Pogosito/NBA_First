This is my first IOS project that I want to rewrite with other architectures and frameworks. I specifically uploaded the project in the "original" to remember how I started my iOS developer journey

At this stage, I didn't have the knowledge to help me write good, beautiful code.
Most of the writing was taken from tutorials, articles, and answers from stackoverflow

I think this project can be considered as a guide to how not to write code
